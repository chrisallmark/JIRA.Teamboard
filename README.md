==============

OVERVIEW
--------
The JIRA Teamboard is an electronic information radiator that displays vital data about the progress of a development team. Traditional agile wallboards use index cards or sticky notes on a wall and the information can become stale very quickly however the JIRA Teamboard is continually updated with in real-time ensuring that the team are always aware of the current state of play.

It's similar to a scoreboard at a sporting event - it's been designed to be highly visible and easy to understand for anyone walking and it can complement or entirely replace a traditional agile wallboard. To continue with the sports analogy it's also a useful tool for "post-match analysis" during team retrospectives to identify areas for improvement.
